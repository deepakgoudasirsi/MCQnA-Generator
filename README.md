# MCQnA Generator from a Custom Document using Generative AI

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Generative AI represents a transformative advancement in artificial intelligence, utilizing deep learning models to create content that mimics human intelligence. This application leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4o mini from OpenAI to automate question creation and answer generation from user-provided documents.

It is designed to support educators, students, and content creators by generating meaningful multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and descriptive answers from materials like PDFs, Word documents, or plain text files.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Accept PDF, Word, or Text files as input.
2. Generate:
   - MCQs with 4 options and the correct answer
   - Descriptive answers to user queries based on the document
3. Evaluate and compare GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4o mini, and deploy the best-performing model.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

The system is divided into two modules:

- **QnA Module**: Accepts a user question and responds with a concise, document-relevant answer using LLMs.
- **MCQ Generation Module**: Analyzes the input document and generates MCQs along with the correct choice.

Both modules use OpenAI's API through Langchain for robust prompt engineering and response handling.
